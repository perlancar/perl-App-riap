Revision history for App-Riap

0.05     2014-06-17 (SHARYANTO)

         - Add --version (-v) for each command/function. --verbose loses the -v
           alias.


0.04     2014-04-16 (SHARYANTO)

         - Pass 'argv' to the server if parsing it on the client side returns
           502. This can happen when coderefs in cmdline_aliases in metadata got
           converted into string 'CODE' due to having to be transported via JSON
           from the server side (Riap::HTTP/Riap::Simple). This also requires a
           recent version of Perinci::Access::Perl (0.64) on the server side,
           which supports accepting 'argv' request key for the 'call' action.

         - Add -v (version).


0.03     2014-01-01 (SHARYANTO)

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Cache some Riap results like meta/info/list to speed up tab
           completion, help, ls.

         - Alias -u for --user, -p for --password; document about
           PERINCI_HTTP_{USER,PASSWORD}

         [BUG FIXES]

         - if 'ls' command mentions path, error 404 if there are no matches.


0.02     2013-11-27 (SHARYANTO)

         [BUG FIXES]

         - Fix Riap requesting so it works with Riap::HTTP, etc.

         - Fix tab completion on path so it mimics shell better (no space
           automatically added after a match on dir).

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Add commands: show, req, meta, info, call.

         - Save command history even though we are interrupted.

         - Add setting: debug_completion to show Riap requests for completion as
           well as completion alternatives.

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

         - Change setting debug_show_{request,response} to debug_riap.


0.01     2013-11-06 (SHARYANTO)
