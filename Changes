Revision history for App-Riap

0.03     2014-01-01 (SHARYANTO)

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Cache some Riap results like meta/info/list to speed up tab
           completion, help, ls.

         - Alias -u for --user, -p for --password; document about
           PERINCI_HTTP_{USER,PASSWORD}

         [BUG FIXES]

         - if 'ls' command mentions path, error 404 if there are no matches.


0.02     2013-11-27 (SHARYANTO)

         [BUG FIXES]

         - Fix Riap requesting so it works with Riap::HTTP, etc.

         - Fix tab completion on path so it mimics shell better (no space
           automatically added after a match on dir).

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Add commands: show, req, meta, info, call.

         - Save command history even though we are interrupted.

         - Add setting: debug_completion to show Riap requests for completion as
           well as completion alternatives.

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

         - Change setting debug_show_{request,response} to debug_riap.
