Revision history for App-Riap

0.02     2013-11-26 (SHARYANTO) (not yet released)

         - Fix Riap requesting so it works with Riap::HTTP, etc.

         - Fix tab completion on path so it mimics shell better (no space
           automatically added after a match on dir).

         - Add commands: show, req, meta, info, call.

         - Save command history even though we are interrupted.

         - Change setting debug_show_{request,response} to debug_riap.

         - Add setting: debug_completion to show Riap requests for completion as
           well as completion alternatives.
